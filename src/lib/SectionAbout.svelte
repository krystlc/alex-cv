        <p>
            Senior Engineer with 6+ years of experience architecting
            high-performance applications across the
            <strong>React</strong>
            and
            <strong>Vue/Nuxt</strong>
            ecosystems. I specialize in building type-safe, scalable frontends using
            <strong>TypeScript</strong>
            ,
            <strong>TanStack</strong>
            , and
            <strong>Zod</strong>
            , while bridging the gap to the backend with
            <strong>Nest.js</strong>
            and
            <strong>GraphQL</strong>
            . Beyond standard UI, I bring niche expertise in geospatial visualization
            with
            <strong>CesiumJS</strong>
            and modern infrastructure via
            <strong>Netlify</strong>
            and
            <strong>Vercel</strong>
            . I focus on delivering "production-ready" code—prioritizing performance
            optimization, accessible design systems with
            <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>
            , and mentoring teams to maintain high-velocity, component-driven workflows.
